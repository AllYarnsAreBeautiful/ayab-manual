### Does AYAB support shaping as well as patterning? Can I upload a non-rectangular shape? If I upload a non-rectangular shape, will ayab prompt me to increase/decrease?
No, AYAB currently only deals with the stitch pattern, it has no features for shaping yet.

Say you want to make a sleeve with an allover pattern, starting with 50 stitches at the cuff and a maximum width at the underarm of 90 stitches. Your stitch pattern file needs to be a rectangle 90 pixels wide. Tell the AYAB software that you are using needles Left45â€”Right45. Cast on 50 stitches (L25-R25) and start knitting, increasing a stitch on both sides every X rows according to your pattern or your own calculations.

**Important**: even on the early rows while the knitting is narrower than the file, you will need to take the carriage out past L45 or R45 on every row. As always, listen for the beep.
