## Create a pattern

Create an image with a width of 200 pixels or less with indexed colours. For two 
color knitwork, choose monochromatic: black and white (1 bit) with each pixel 
representing a stitch. Save in the bitmap format. 
The following instructions show how to achieve this using the free open source 
software GIMP 2.10.10 (or newer): 


## Using GIMP to create patterns and save as bitmap file

1. Download GIMP 2.10.10 (or newer) from [the GIMP homepage](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) 
   and install it.
2. Run GIMP
3. In GIMP, left-click File -> New
4. Select the hight and width in pixels (= number of rows and stitches per row, 
   respectively), then left-click "OK".
5. In GIMP, left-click Image -> Modus -> Indexed. In the dialog that pops up, 
   select "black/white (1bit)" for textiles with two colors. 
6. Select the pencil tool (hotkey: N) 
7. Set the pencil tool settings to Size = 1.00 (1x1 pixel), Hardness = 100, 
   keep other tool options at default settings (Dynamics Off). Keep default 
   foreground color (black) and background color (white).
8. Optionally show grid: Left-click View -> Show Grid. Then, left-click 
   Image -> Configure Grid. Set Spacing:Horizontal = 1.00 pixels and 
   Spacing:Vertical = 1.00 pixels. Left-click "OK".    
9. Draw the pattern (Zoom in using View -> Zoom to see individual pixels):  
   so that background color is represented by white pixels and contrast color 
   (foreground) is represented by black pixels. 
10. In GIMP, left-click File -> "Export as". In the "Export Image" dialog that 
   pops up, type in a file name and select the target directory, then 
   left-click "Select File Type (By Extension)" -> "Windows BMP image (.bmp)", 
   then left-click "Export". 
11. You can close GIMP now.
