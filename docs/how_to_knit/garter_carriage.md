# Garter carriage

## Setup

Make sure:
  - You're using the 1.0 desktop software and the latest firmware. The garter carriage is not supported in older versions.
  - Your garter carriage is compatible with your machine. [Compatibility chart](https://www.needlesofsteel.org.uk/compat-brother.html#garter)
  - You know how to use your garter carriage with your machine. You can find manuals at [MKManuals](https://mkmanuals.com/)

## Getting started

Cast on either to waste yarn or your main yarn.

Get the garter carriage set up and put it on the bed so that both sets of magnets are outside of the turn mark.

Open your image in the AYAB desktop software. 

Click knit.

Start the garter carriage. 

When the first set of magnets has passed the turn mark, the desktop software should identify the garter carriage, load the pattern, and keep going.

## Known Issue

The desktop software does not hold a wake lock so your computer won't stay awake. If your computer goes to sleep, it may mess up the patterning on your knitting machine.

[WikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Keep-Your-Computer-Awake) has some instructions for how to keep your computer awake.

You can also open a browser and play a YouTube video. As long as the browser is in the foreground and a video is playing, the computer will stay awake.
