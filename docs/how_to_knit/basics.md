# Basics

## Single Bed Fair Isle

To create your own patterns, refer to [section "Pattern creation"](../pattern_image_creation.md). 
Carriage part names are defined on page 32 of the [KH910 manual](http://mkmanuals.com/brother-kh910-user-guide.html).

For your first practice sample, we will use this Triangles image that comes with
AYAB:

![triangles_60x10.png](img/dbj_2-color/triangles_60x10.png){: style="width:300px;height:50px;image-rendering:crisp-edges;display:block;margin:auto"}

1. Cast on using needles Left30 - Right30 with your main yarn and knit a few rows of stockinette, ending on the left 
   (KH910 manual, pp. 10-15, 18-21).
1. Position the carriage so that the magnet on the center back of the carriage is outside the left turn mark.
1. Run the AYAB software. In AYAB, left-click “Open Image File” or choose “Open Image File” from the File menu and select the file `triangles_60x10.png` that is located in the folder that opens by default (if you want to knit a different pattern, choose a black/white raster image, preferably in `.png` file format. It must be at least as wide as the needles you are using).
1. In the AYAB software, leave all the settings as they are: Single Bed, Colors 2, Infinite Repeat unchecked, Start Row 1, Start Needle 30, Stop Needle 30, Alignment Center, Knit Side Image unchecked. 
1. Click Knit. Wait until it says “Please start machine.” 
1. Set the KC change knob to KC1 or KC2.
1. Move the carriage so the magnet on the back of the carriage crosses the left turn mark. You should hear a "triple-beep".
1. Continue across the row. After you pass the end of the selected needles, it should beep.
Our pattern has some black squares in row 1, you can see that they have been selected forward to D position.

If you are "air-knitting" (no yarn) you can just continue passing the carriage back and forth from here and observe how the machine moves needles to B or D position according to the pattern. Otherwise, if you're ready for actual Fair Isle knitting:

1. Stop when the carriage is on the right at the end of the first row.
1. Press the top half of the center button on the front of the carriage (or the whole center button ("MC") if yours is all one piece, see KH910 manual, p.42).
1. Thread the second yarn into feeder B, and hold the loose end of the yarn for the first few stitches (KH910 manual, p.42).

Knit back and forth. There's a beep at the end of each row, that tells you when it's safe to turn around and start the next row. You can also watch the row numbers count up in the software.

At row 10, you'll see "Image Transmission finished." Knit until the long beep, then stop and look at the needles. Notice that it has selected the needles for row 10, but we haven't knitted them yet. So knit one more pass from left to right. Now we have really finished, all needles are at B.

Set the KC knob to NL, cut and unthread the contrast yarn and knit a few rows of the main yarn (KH910 manual, p.43).
Binding off is described on page 22 or pages 111-114 of the KH910 manual.
