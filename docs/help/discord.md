# Getting help

## Discord

We do most user support on Discord. Please direct your questions to the [#help](https://discord.gg/jafq6UJaDc) channel.

## Beta

We're currently running a Beta to test the next version of the software. If you'd like to join and have some time to help find bugs, please fill out this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScrvKoOgSTzqSSM6C5RM8FxQkjqvx_cg5yfC1-vhSgppvmkvA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## File a bug

You can file a bug through [Github](https://github.com/AllYarnsAreBeautiful/ayab-desktop/issues). Click the green "New Issue" button and give us as much detail as you can. 

Please include the version of the software that you're working with. If you're in the beta, navigate to `Help` -> `About` and include the string there.

We may reach out for more information if we need it.

If you don't have a github account then let us know what's going on on Discord.
