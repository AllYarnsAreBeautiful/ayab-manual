And thanks to Cindy for suggesting this feature in the first place. I\u2019m using AYAB v0.9, this was also available in 0.8. (First draft Sept 26, 2017, minor edits Nov 9, 2017) The Circular technique is knitted in a very similar way to 2-color DBJ (Double Bed Jacquard, AYAB\u2019s \u201cRibber\u201d setting,) but Circular makes a 2-color stockinette tube. The Circular feature is the closest we can come to circular fair-isle on a Brother machine. It helps to already be familiar with the standard ribber cast-on and with 2-color DBJ before attempting Circular. This tutorial is very detailed but most of it is the casting on and setting up; the actual circular part consists of four passes of the carriage with two changes of color. Steps 11 - 14 are the AYAB setup, and 15 - 20 are the actual knitting. For our first time through we will make one-row stripes on the ribber, there will be two rows on the ribber for every one completed row on the main bed. So the ribber side ends up twice as long as the patterned side knitted on the main bed, making a rather oddly shaped tube. This sample is a 64 stitch circle, L16-R16 on each bed. Stitch Size of T6/5 (Main 6, Ribber 5) is about right as a sample for a possible sock in Sock-Ease yarn from Lion Brand. Or try going a bit tighter on the ribber to get a more balanced tube. Steps 2 - 6 are a standard circular cast-on, with a small variation from the settings described in the manual Choose a fair-isle pattern. It must have short floats, especially near the edges of the width you plan to use. And no rows that are entirely either color, which would be a whole-row float. My sample is StitchWorld #27, you can download and use this file. Install your ribber and color changer. Set the connected carriages on the right. Rack the ribber to its central position, (5) and set the P-H to H. All settings on both carriages to normal, see p30 of the KR850 manual. Thread the white yarn on the left side of the mast, black on the right. Thread the black into button 1 of the CC, and anchor it underneath. No buttons selected on the color changer yet. Take the white yarn behind the black and over to the carriage to start the cast on from the right. Select needles L16 - R16 on both beds, and cast on for circular. Follow page 30 in the 850 manual, EXCEPT, after the zigzag row set just the RIGHT Part button on the main bed, and on the ribber set the LEFT slider up to P.R. and the right one down on N. Middle slider down. Side levers up, bottom slider on I. Both lili buttons to normal. Set the Stitch Sizes, try 6 on the main bed and 5 on the ribber. (Use ravel cord for the initial zigzag if you want an open tube, or you can just snip the cast-on later.) Knit the zigzag row, hang the cast-on comb and one or two ribber weights. Set P-H to P. Leave the rest of the settings the same as the cast on. Knit a few rows of plain circular, about 12 passes (6 circular rounds) in white ending COL (Carriage on Left). Press button 2 on the CC so it is open to catch the white yarn, and put the carriage all the way out on the left into the color changer. The carriage waits here while we do the pattern setup. Main carriage: KC knob to KC2, both Part buttons in. Ribber carriage: No changes. Check that the left slider is up (P.R, or Part) right slider down (N, knit) Row counter = 000 In AYAB: open the image, which must be at least as wide as the main bed needles you are using. Set the start/stop needles to the width you are knitting on the main bed, 16 and 16 in our example (or one or two wider, just be sure the settings are not narrower than your actual needles); 2 colors; start at row 1 (usually); Infinite Repeat; Circular; Center. Click Configure, then Knit. Press Color Changer button 1 to select black. Move the carriage out of the color changer and over the left turn mark. Stop and wait for the triple beep. And check that only the black yarn was selected. Knit across, left - right, wait for the beep. Knit across, right - left and all the way into the color changer, the beep should happen as you do so. Press CC button 2, for white. Knit across, left - right, wait for the beep. Knit across, right - left and into the color changer, the beep should happen as you do so. Press CC button 1, for black. Repeat steps 16 - 21 for the rest of the project. For this sample do about 20 rows (80 passes.) See the note below about hanging extra weights on the ribber\u2019s knitting. To finish the sample, cancel the main carriage settings from step 7. Set to standard circular (KC button at NL, right part button pushed in on main carriage, left slider up at P.R. on the ribber as before, no lili) and knit about 12 passes (6 rounds) in just one color. Bind off if you like, or just cut the yarn, hold onto the comb below and take the carriage across and back to let the knitting drop off. Notes: The left-right rows knit on the ribber and select on the main bed. The right-left rows knit on the main bed leaving all needles in B afterwards, and slip (nothing knits) on the ribber. Don\u2019t try to knit too fast. On the right you need to wait for the beep, and on the left give it time to take up the slack yarn as you approach the knitting. Also gives you time to check that the new yarn is correctly in the feeder. Watch the row numbers in AYAB as you knit. Note that 4 passes make 1 row; the row counter will say 4 when AYAB has just switched up from 1 and is starting the sequence of four passes for row 2. (AYAB v0.8 numbered the rows differently.) As always with ribber work, stop with the carriage on the right after about 5 full rows (20 passes) to check: unhook the starting ends of the yarn make sure the ribber weights and comb are not caught on anything underneath feel along the knitting on both sides from underneath, you may be able to tell if a loop is caught around a gate peg. hang the \u201csevens\u201d wires and weights if the edge stitches are having trouble knitting off. you generally don\u2019t need the fine knit bar for circular knitting. IMPORTANT: hang some claw weights on the ribber side of the knitting, nearest to you. Make sure they hook into just the ribber-side layer of the knitting. This is because the ribber side is growing faster and its stitches need extra weight to stay on the needles. Then check again after several inches have been knit, by now you may be able to put a mirror underneath and check that the pattern you want is appearing on the work on the side away from you, and stripes on the side facing you. Look at your sample. Note that the striped back is twice as long as the front. Further instructions soon for a way to prevent that and make a balanced tube. And I think I just found a use for the unbalanced tube, and developed a new way to do socks! The heel and foot are seamless fair-isle-in-the-round. No short rows. Here\u2019s the first prototype, the only seam (up the back of the leg) isn\u2019t sewn yet. Full tutorial coming soon. This article is copied from ravelry . Thanks, Adrienne! Feel free to improve it!","title":"Circular Knitting"},{"location":"how_to_knit/dbj_2-color/","text":"Introduction Instructions for 2-color Double Bed Jacquard (AYAB\u2019s \u201cRibber\u201d setting.) DBJ is known in Brother manuals as Multi-Colour Rib. See page 38 of the KR850 ribber manual (the penguins) and page 11 of the manual for the KRC-900 color changer. Note that DBJ in 3 or more colors has some differences, though the basic instructions are the same. Smiley was made from this image: AYAB takes care of the colors for you, you just give it a black-and-white pattern as if you are going to do single bed Fair Isle. Use thin yarns, you\u2019ll be using side-by-side needles on both beds. (for those in the US, Woollike yarn works well.) For your first practice sample, use this Triangles image that also comes with AYAB 0.9, find it in Documents>AYAB>patterns. which looks like this: The useful thing about this Triangles pattern is that row 1 selects 1 black needle per triangle, row 2 selects groups of 2, row 3 groups of 3 etc. If you watch the needle selection carefully you\u2019ll start to understand what it\u2019s doing. Instructions Set up the color changer with the black yarn; the white slot is open ready to accept the yarn after the cast on. You might need the fine knit bar. Try it if your stitches sometimes tuck instead of knitting off. On the ribber, set P-H lever to H, Rack=5 Needles L30-R30 on both beds for our first Triangles sample Make sure you have an even number of stitches on the ribber. Cast on in white in FNR (Full Needle Rib) as shown on page 26 of the KR850 manual. Knit one or two rows of FNR. Carriage on left, outside the left turn mark. Set the row counter, RC=000 Set up the carriages as shown on page 39 of the KR850 manual: Page 39.png Main bed: Both part buttons in; KC1 or KC2. I usually use KC2 rather than KC1. Ribber: Both sliders (cam levers) up. Both lili buttons to lili. Lower slide lever to lili (center). Stitch Size depends on your yarn. Try 4/4. Open a black/white image in AYAB. It must be at least as wide as the needles you are using. Set AYAB to 2-color, start at row 1, Infinite Repeat, start/stop needles 30/30, Ribber, Center. Configure Knit Press the color changer button for the black yarn Bring the carriage out past the turn mark and stop to wait for the triple-beep as usual, just on this first row. Also check that the black yarn is in the feeder, and if this is its first row, check that the yarn end is hanging straight down and isn\u2019t caught anywhere. Knit across, wait for the beep. Knit back and into the color changer, the beep happens as you do so. Press the button to change to white. Knit across, wait for the beep. Knit back and into the color changer, the beep happens as you do so. Press the button to change to black That\u2019s it, repeat: Knit across, knit back, change color. After the first set AYAB will have counted up two rows and be starting row 3, the row counter will show 4 passes. After about 10 rows (20 passes), stop with the carriage on the right and check: let the starting ends of the yarn hang free make sure the ribber weights and comb are not caught on anything underneath feel along the knitting on both sides from underneath, you may be able to tell if a loop is caught around a gate peg. hang the \u201csevens\u201d wires and weights if the edge stitches are having trouble knitting off. Then check again after several inches have been knit, by now you may be able to put a mirror underneath and check that the pattern you want is appearing on the work on the side away from you, and birdseye stripes on the side facing you. More description on how 2-color DBJ works In our Triangles sample with Infinite Repeat on, let\u2019s stop and observe, with the carriage on the left at the beginning of row 1 of its cycle of ten rows. We have just changed to the black yarn ready for the next row 1 as displayed in AYAB. Remember that AYAB\u2019s row numbering focuses on what\u2019s being selected not what\u2019s being knitted. Notice that what\u2019s selected now is the last set of 10 black needles to complete the previous triangle. Knit across from left-right. It has completed knitting the previous triangle, and has selected sets of 1 needle to do the first point of the next triangle. Knit across right-left and change color to white. Stop again and observe before you knit the row. It has just knitted the single black stitches, and selected sets of 9 to be the white stitches that go in between the single black ones for that same row. The sequence of 4 passes for two rows is: Pass 1: Black yarn, knit whatever it was given by the last selection of the previous set. Select for the black stitches for row 1 of this set of two rows. Pass 2: Black yarn, Knit the first black stitches, select for the white stitches that will go in between the black stitches we just knitted, also for row 1 of this set. Change color to white. Pass 3: White yarn, knit the selected needles to complete row 1, select for the white stitches of row 2 of this set. Pass 4: White yarn, knit the selected needles, select for the black stitches of row 2 of this set. Change color to black. Notice that the selection is an \u201cABBA\u201d sequence. Black, white, white, black; repeat. Each set of four passes does the selections for two rows of the pattern. But the set is not completely self-contained, its first pass completes the knitting of the previous set, and its fourth pass does a selection which will be knitted in the first pass of the next set of four passes. You\u2019ll see discussions about Brother 2-color DBJ needing to start by selecting from the right, so how does that square with AYAB always starting from the left? I think it\u2019s just an alternative way of thinking about how 2-color DBJ works. In the AYAB context where everything starts from the left, each set of 4 passes has provided the selection for the next set during its last right-left pass. So in a sense the first selection of the set did start on the right; in AYAB that is counted as the last pass of the previous set. Further observations Color changers are not 100% reliable, though there are adjustments you can make. Occasionally it will grab both yarns or neither, and disaster ensues. Use the slower rhythm enforced by AYAB to take a look at the yarn in the feeder every time as it come out of the color changer. You may be able to stop in time to fix it. AYAB 0.9 and earlier expect the black yarn first. The more usual convention is to do the white first, more intuitive. That will likely be changed in a future release of AYAB; for now the instructions describe black first. Otherwise 2-color DBJ works well as it is, doesn\u2019t particularly need any code changes. You might be wondering what happens on the very first pass. There\u2019s nothing pre-selected on the main bed, so it only knits on the ribber (alternating needles because of the lili settings) while selecting for the first black pattern stitches. Technically I think that means that there\u2019s an extra ribber row at the beginning, but it gets absorbed into the backing pattern and is not noticeable. In subsequent first passes of the cycle of 4 passes/2 rows, it has been provided with selected needles to knit in black. How do you end your pattern on exactly the right row at the end of a repeat? In Infinite Repeat you\u2019ll need to do one or two passes of the next cycle, but cancelling any selection on the second pass. In non-repeating, the long beep sounds after it has selected for the last row. Knit one or two more passes. When using the lili settings, you must have an even number of stitches on the ribber. Take a look at the sides of your sample, do you want to have the edge stitch always on the main bed? (Optional, but may look better) To keep an even number on the ribber, your main bed will need on odd number of stitches. Doing some FNR after the cast-on and before starting the pattern can make a wavy edge. With careful management, it\u2019s possible to use the last circular row of your cast-on as the first (setup) row of your pattern. Sometimes you want DBJ all in one color. Just make an image that\u2019s all white or all black, no color-changing needed. Some of Brother\u2019s DBJ instructions claim that the extra \u201clatch plate\u201d to add to the ribber connector arm is required. See page 49 of the 930/940 manual. Not so, it\u2019s optional. In fact when I tried it it seemed to make things worse, the color change was less reliable. (Latch plate is misspelled as Clatch Plate in the 930/940 manual.) This article is copied from ravelry .
